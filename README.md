Skyline Artificial General intelligence. AGI Machine Learning Model

Project Creation Location: 
Philippines, Mindanao, Davao Del Sur, Santacruz

### **Project Overview**
SkylineAGI-Mv4 is an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) framework focusing on dynamic problem-solving and learning without relying on massive datasets like traditional Large Language Models (LLMs). It uses a **multi-tiered database structure** to manage domain-specific knowledge efficiently.

# Skyline AGI Mv4

Welcome to **Skyline AGI Mv4**, an advanced artificial general intelligence framework designed to dynamically handle tasks of varying complexity. This version builds upon previous iterations, integrating lessons learned and enhancing performance through sophisticated model selection and management.

## Features

### Dynamic Complexity Handling

Skyline AGI Mv4 introduces a robust **dynamic complexity handling** feature that allows the system to adaptively select models based on the complexity of tasks. This capability ensures optimal resource utilization and improved performance, allowing the framework to efficiently manage both simple and complex tasks.

### Enhanced Model Selection

The model selection mechanism has been significantly improved. The system now utilizes a tiered approach that dynamically adjusts based on task requirements, ensuring that the most appropriate model is employed for each scenario. This results in better accuracy and efficiency across various applications.

## Architecture Overview

Skyline AGI Mv4 is built upon a modular architecture that enhances maintainability and scalability. The core components include:

- **main.py**: The central controller responsible for initializing processes and distributing tasks.
- **knowledge_base.py**: Manages a structured knowledge base for dynamic storage and retrieval of information.
- **models.py**: Implements an advanced model selection mechanism based on task complexity.
- **async_process_manager.py**: Handles asynchronous task management to optimize resource usage.
- **optimization.py**: Contains functions for Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters.

### **Folder and File Structure**
1. **`src/`**: Core source code, including logic for dynamic data handling and self-learning.
2. **`data/`**: Stores domain-specific datasets (e.g., `math_dataset1.csv` to `math_dataset9.csv`).
3. **`config.json`**: Central configuration file for dynamic activation functions, complexity factors, and knowledge base settings.
4. **`domain_dataset.json`**: Master dataset list referencing file paths and metadata.
5. **`docs/`**: Documentation for system design and API details.
6. **`tests/`**: Unit tests to validate system functionality.
